# Releasing

Releases are manual, single-commit affairs. The maintainer controls the changelog voice and format. `@scriptc/runtime`, every platform helper/runtime pack, `@scriptc/compiler`, and `scriptc` always publish together at the same version.

To prepare a release:

1. Bump the version in `packages/cli/package.json`
2. Run `node scripts/sync-versions.mjs` to stamp the same version into the runtime, helper, and compiler packages, then `pnpm manifest` to restamp `packages/compiler/surface-manifest.json` with the new version, and commit both (the test suite's staleness guard fails on a version drift)
3. Fold the `## Unreleased` section of `CHANGELOG.md` into a new `## <version>` entry (newest first, below `## Unreleased`), and leave `## Unreleased` empty for the next cycle
4. Wrap the new entry in `<!-- release:start -->` and `<!-- release:end -->` markers; this marked block is also the GitHub release body
5. Remove the `<!-- release:start -->` and `<!-- release:end -->` markers from the previous release entry; only the latest release should have markers
6. With Zig on `PATH`, run `SCRIPTC_CROSS=1 pnpm exec vitest run tests/harness/library-cross.test.ts` and require the cross-target library conformance lane to pass
7. Commit to `main`

CI (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) compares the version in `packages/cli/package.json` to what `scriptc` has on npm. If it differs, it builds platform packages on matching macOS, Linux, and Windows runners, verifies the version spine, and publishes the runtime, helper, compiler, and CLI packages in dependency order. After the publish succeeds, a separate job creates the git tag `v<version>` and the GitHub release with the marked changelog entry as its body, and attaches `surface-manifest.json` — the machine-readable listing of the surface the static tier compiles at that version (stable per-entry ids, so two releases diff mechanically; see `packages/compiler/src/coverage/surface-manifest.ts` for the schema). The job regenerates the manifest from the tree and fails on any byte difference from the committed file before attaching, so the asset is always the manifest of the code being released. The same file ships inside the `@scriptc/compiler` package as `@scriptc/compiler/surface-manifest.json`.

The release job builds each pinned LLVM helper, precompiled runtime pack, and native CLI on its matching host. The native CLI bundles its TypeScript checker, LLVM helper, runtime pack, declarations, and comptime evaluator. npm postinstall installs the matching native executable; Node is needed for npm installation but not native compilation or execution. The user's toolchain performs the final platform link. Sanitized builds also use it to instrument program LLVM and compile the C runtime. Platform packages publish ahead of `@scriptc/compiler` and `scriptc`. The GitHub release attaches standalone compiler archives, their SHA-256 checksums, and the surface manifest after npm publication succeeds.

Publishing uses npm trusted publishing (OIDC) — there is no npm token secret.
Each published package must have a GitHub Actions trusted publisher for
`release.yml` and the `Release` environment. A missing configuration fails
before upload. Re-runs skip package versions already present on npm, so a
partially published release can be resumed safely.
